title: "Intermezzo II"

Welcome to the third and last workshop of the "Introduction to Modern Software Engineering Series".

There is already quite a bit of material that has been covered in the first two workshops, and by
now you should have a good understanding, and some practice using some very important modern software
development tools and technologies, such as

- Version control
- Git
- GitLab
- Python Virtual Environments

On the last part of our last workshop we have started focusing on programming topics, by looking at
Python virtual environments. In today's workshop, we will expand this programming focus, and look at
at a very important software engineering area - **Clean Code**.

Unlike previous topics in this course, which were very much focused on specific tools, **Clean Code**
does not focus just on tools, but rather on a methodology on how to approach software development.
The emphasis here is on continuous improvement, such that each new program that you will write can take
you one step closer to this clean code ideal.

Our goal for this workshop is to get you started on this learning and self-improvement
journey. To prepare you for this journey, we will first look what clean code actually means; we will
then follow with some fundamental rules that when followed facilitate writing clean code,
introduce some tools that help enforcing these rules, and finish with a fairly elaborate
software project where you can practice and apply everything you have learned.
To summarize, the high level planning for this workshop is the following:

- Explaining "Clean Code"
- "Clean Code" rules
- Short break
- "Clean Code" tools
- Lunch break
- "Clean Code" project
