title: Introduction
---

The purpose of this course is to introduce the basics of professional software development to 
QuTech PhD students and researchers. We firmly believe that adopting professional software development 
practices throughout our research organization will yield significant long-term advantages, including:

- Faster onboarding of new PhD students
- Efficiencies across the organization through potential software and know-how reuse
- More transparent and reproducible results for research that relies on in-house built software tools

The course is structured in three parts intended to be offered as half-day workshops:

- Part 1 (Episodes 1, 2, 3) starts by framing the course in the context of the QuTech Software Maturity Model, and then
dwells into its technical content by introducing the fundamentals of version control and Git.
- Part 2 (Episodes 4, 5, and 6) introduces GitLab, and its support for more advanced Git workflows and ends with
introducing the basics of Python Virtual Environments.
- Part 3 (Episode 7) covers the basics of "clean code", with a focus on Python and its development tools ecosystem. 

Each workshop should take between three and four hours, and will consist of three one hour modules split by 
breaks. The first break will be around ten minutes, while the second one around 30 minutes - during which lunch will 
be served.

This course focuses on practical knowledge that can be immediately applied. It also emphasizes "learning by doing", 
with several hands-on, interactive assignments designed to help participants practice and apply newly introduced 
concepts and tools.

This course has no prerequisites. However, participants should have an interest or affinity for Python programming 
and a basic understanding of using Linux/Unix command line interfaces.

## Course Material Format
The course material is presented on a website. You can use the left navigation panel to move between lectures (episodes)
and between the main sections of an episode. We are using the [Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/)
to provide a uniform look-and-feel to the course material. The most important UI blocks you will see throughout the course are
*callouts* and *challenges* 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

#### Callout

A **callout** is a specially formatted content block used to highlight important information in a lesson. 
Callouts help quickly identify key points, warnings, or additional insights. We will go over some of the
callouts together, while you will be asked to approach some of the other ones as self-study.

#### Challenge

A **challenge** is a hands-on exercise where you will be asked to put in practice some of the concepts you
have just learned. These may be individual or group work. Once you have completed the challenge you can also
look at one possible solution we provide, by clicking on the "Show me the solution" link.
